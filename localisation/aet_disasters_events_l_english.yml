 disasters_aet.EVTDESC0001:0 "The vast majority of our armed forces are now totally ineffective. While we still have some operational forces in the field, our ability to maintain them or recruit additional reinforcements is severely impededed. Our generals are reporting that our garrisons are suffering from desertion en-masse, and regimental commanders are ignoring orders, standing down or retreating across the nation."

 grand_conspiracy_desc:0 "Enemies lurk in the shadows. No one can be trusted. Whispers follow our leadership and behind every wall, ever door, every smiling face is malicious intent, personal ambition, traitors and rotten corruption."
 grand_conspiracy.EVTNAME0001:0 "Grand Conspiracy Exposed"
 grand_conspiracy.EVTDESC0001:0 "Our attempt to consolidate our grasp on the court and remove one of our most problematic ministers has proven disasterous. The target has acted pre-emptively and has apparently gathered extensive amounts of supporters who oppose our rule, while the men we sent to arrest him have been killed, along with several of our loyal statesmen. Fighting has now erupted across our capital city as forces loyal to us or the conspirators clash, trying to establish control over key districts and causing extensive damage."
 grand_conspiracy.EVTOPTA0001:0 "We must pray we overcome the traitors."
 grand_conspiracy.EVTNAME0002:0 "The traitors escape!"
 grand_conspiracy.EVTDESC0002:0 "Although we have been victorious in the struggle for the capital, loyalist elements were unable to apprehend the key players behind the conspiracy, and reports from witnesses claim they saw many men riding with haste out of the city gates. No doubt the traitors have pulled back to their power base to plot their next move."
 grand_conspiracy.EVTOPTA0002:0 "We prevail, for now."
