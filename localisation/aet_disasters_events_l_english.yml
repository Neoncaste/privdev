Multiple sultans and political factions have forced us into a political crisis, forced to carry out administrative and financial reforms we are at a cruical point in our history. This will either be the end of the Ottoman Empire or a graceful period of reform and economic growth. Only time will tell..."

 grand_conspiracy.EVTDESC0001:0 "Our attempt to consolidate our grasp on the court and remove one of our most problematic ministers has proven disasterous. The target has acted pre-emptively and has apparently gathered extensive amounts of supporters who oppose our rule, and the men we sent to arrest him have been killed, along with several of our loyal statesmen. Fighting has now erupted across our capital city as forces loyal to us or the conspirators clash, trying to establish control over key districts and causing extensive damage."
